## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

I've learned how to better use Javascript when creating forms and events for buttons.

### Continued development

I still need to learn how to properly alocate semi-transparent background patterns. They're hard on the eyes and harder to figure out how to place properly if the design if strange.
